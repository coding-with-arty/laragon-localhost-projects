              I began this journey with sitting in my cell and teaching myself music, by doing this it allowed me to step away from the gang life and find a new path. Shortly after this I began training dogs for America's VetDogs in a Massachussets prison. In 2023 I was transferred back to the state of Maine where I originally was sentenced to prison, my reason for transfer was disciplinary but with good behavior over a period of years they brought me back.

              <p>
              I have spent many years in prison, I never thought I would see myself here or rather prison was never a factor into my existence. I grew up in a small town in central maine where I overcame abuse, neglect and violence throughout my childhood which made me into a soldier. I knew the bad and I knew the good my country had to offer so I enlisted into the military. I was a good soldier, I completed many things and made a difference in my surroundings but unfortunately due to injuries sustained I was no linger able to serve my country.</p>
              <p>
                Struggling sseverly from PTSD and childhood traumas I fell into addiction and spiraled out of control in a situation that most humans could have resolved in a conversation... I could not and it cost my friend his life at my hand, I hated myself for this for years and gave up on life. I went down a very dark path of violence and gang life in prison that caused so much harm and took more lives, three to be exact. I saw myself different from those around me and thus set myself apart and dehumanized other prisoners. I dealt with every situation with the utmost violence in an instant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then I met my brother Rob and he got me to stop living in hate and shame for what I had done, this led me to begin to change my life around. I got a guitar and taught myself music which enabled me to stay away from the gang politics. I joined a program to trian service dogs for veterans and in helping others I was able to help myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today I work as a recovery coach and peer mentor, I am a full time college student for computer science and I teach in the education department within the prison I am in. Thank you for reading this and I hope that by sharing a part of myself and my struggles you are able to relate to the person in your life that may need help.
