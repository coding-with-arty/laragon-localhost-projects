                <h2>A Community Honor That Reflects Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Bread of Life Ministries was awarded the Readers’ Choice Award for Best Non-Profit
                    Organization, an honor made possible by the people we serve and the community that stands
                    with us. This recognition isn’t just a badge — it is a testament to decades of hands-on work
                    providing daily meals, emergency shelter, supportive housing, and stability for individuals
                    and families facing hardship in Augusta and the surrounding region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being chosen by local residents carries weight; it means our neighbors see the impact, trust
                    our mission, and believe in the value we bring to the community. Paired with the image from
                    the award ceremony, this achievement serves as a reminder that our work resonates beyond our
                    walls, and that the community we support continues to support us in return.
